# Diagnostic-Analytics-to-superstore-dataset
In this project we made an interactive dashboard using PowerBI, to applying diagnostic analytics on dataset, that called: superstore from Kaggle. 
# Main analytics steps:
## 1. Made clustered chart to show the relationship between (Sales & Profit by Category) -> to answer on quesion: Which category sells a lot but loses money?
## 2. Bar chart to show the relationship between (Profit by Sub-Category)->  to answer on quesion:Which products cause losses?
## 3.Matrix  to make Comparison between (Region vs Profit) )->  to answer on quesion: Which region-category combination performs badly?
## 4.slicers for: Year, Region and Category.-> to answer :Why did sales decrease this year in this region?

# At the End of this work we Answered to some Analytics questions from the dashboard ( For years 2014-2017):

. Which category sells a lot but loses money? -> Furniture and especially tables product.

.Which products cause losses? -> Tables

.Which region-category combination performs badly? -> Furniture category in Central Region that caused the badly profits(losses)

.Is high sales always equal to high profit? -> In this case yes
. Which region is risky? -> Central
